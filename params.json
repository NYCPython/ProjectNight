{"name":"Project Night","google":"","body":"NYC Python Project Night\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a bunch of (hopefully) useful information for\r\nbeginners. It has one main goal:\r\n\r\n    **To get you from being uncomfortable joining one of the projects to \r\n    being comfortable as quickly as possible.**\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of knowledge that is part of a developer's toolkit.\r\nHopefully, enough information is contained in these documents and the documents\r\nlinked from them to give budding developers or recent Python migrants the\r\nconfidence and knowledge to get the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly lots of things that will be missing here. It's hard at\r\ntimes for developers who have knowledge in these areas to remember what it was\r\nlike to be a beginner, and how to best transmit the information and experience\r\nthey've gained. If you see something missing *please add it*. Your\r\ncontributions are most welcome.\r\n\r\nOverall, there will be at least one important piece of information that does\r\nnot appear anywhere in these files and so it should be highlighted here:\r\n\r\n    **Be bold and curious, and unafraid to ask for help.**\r\n\r\nAsk other members at the meetup and otherwise for advice, for help, or for\r\nguidance. If they are willing they'll help (and many are) and if they aren't\r\nthey'll be sure to tell you or try to point you someplace you can look\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","tagline":"A collection of resources for beginners wanting to contribute at NYC Project Nights (or otherwise learn the ropes)","note":"Don't delete this file!
